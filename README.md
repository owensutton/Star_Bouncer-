My Scratch Project is a video game. To operate the game, you use the left and right arrow keys. There are three "falling" stars, Your objective is to keep the three stars from touching the red line seen at the bottom of the screen. You have three lives, and lose a life if a star touches the red line. The game ends when you have 0 lives. For each time you stop a star from touching the red line you get a point. If you reach a score of 20 points, the background changes.
